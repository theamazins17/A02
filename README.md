**Knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub** <br>

**Intro to Git:** <br>
Git helps track any possible code changes, who made those changes, and collaboration. You can make repositories and clone those repositories. You can also track changes by looking at the past commits made to the repository. Branching and merging help with getting specific parts of the repository. Pull gets the latest version of the repository, while push with update the repository locally.<br>
<br>
**Intro to Webstorm:** <br>
Webstorm is a software through JetBrains that uses both Git and GitHub to commit changes and update repositories. You can download it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/
<br><br>
"WebStorm is an integrated development environment for JavaScript and related technologies. Like other JetBrains IDEs, it makes your development experience more enjoyable, automating routine work and helping you handle complex tasks with ease." This is straight from the home page of WebStorm: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/. <br><br>
**Intro to GitHub:** <br>
GitHub is a hosting platform where it has easy-to-use version control and collaboration. Though Git is in the name of GitHub, they are not the same. GitHub has the tools to use Git, for an easier process.<br><br><br>
**How All 3 Work Together:** <br>
1. First download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Then make an account with JetBrains and download Webstorm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
3. After this you want to make a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
4. Open up WebStorm and click `Crtl + Alt + S` to open up system preferences. In version control, select Git and find its file path.
5. Click `Test` once you have selected Git.
6. Once you see the pop-up `"Git Executed Successfully"`, you can click `OK` to exit.
7. Open up GitHub, click the plus sign near your account picture, and click `New repository`.
8. Make the repository public by clicking the Public option. Also, make sure to name your repository something unique. After you have done all of this click `Create`.
9. Open up WebStorm again and select `VCS` and then `Import Control`. You want to create a `Git Repository`.
10. On the home page of WebStorm, click `Checkout` --> version control --> Git. Enter the repository name of the one you just made in GitHub and also enter it's local path name.
11. Now to create the WebStorm file, choose File --> HTML --> HTML5.
12. Once you do create this file a pop-up will show up: `Add to Git`. Click add and this will add locally.
13. Click the files you would like to commit and add a message detailing the changes you have made. Then click `Commit`.
14. If you want to push changes remotely, click `Crtl + Shift + K`.
15. Open back up the repository in GitHub, you may have to reload the page, and you will see the file will be now updated.
16. To create a `README.md`, click a new file and rename it `README.md`. Enter some text and click commit.
17. To choose your repository's page location opening up settings of the repository. Make sure the branch is `Master Branch` and take note of the URL.
18. Copy and paste the URL and it should show the entered code, text, etc.
19. Congrats you now know how Git, GitHub, and WebStorm work together!
