**Knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub**

**Intro to Git:**<br>
Git helps track any possible code changes, who made those changes, and collaboration. You can make repositories and clone those repositories. You can also track changes by looking at the past commits made to the repository. Branching and merging help with getting specific parts of the repository. Pull gets the latest version of the repository, while push with update the repository locally.<br>
<br>
**Intro to Webstorm:**<br>
Webstorm is a software through JetBrains that uses both Git and GitHub to commit changes and update repositories. You can download it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/

"WebStorm is an integrated development environment for JavaScript and related technologies. Like other JetBrains IDEs, it makes your development experience more enjoyable, automating routine work and helping you handle complex tasks with ease." This is straight from the home page of WebStorm: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/. <br><br>
**Intro to GitHub:**<br>
GitHub is a hosting platform where it has easy-to-use version control and collaboration. Though Git is in the name of GitHub, they are not the same. GitHub has the tools to use Git, for an easier process.<br><br>
